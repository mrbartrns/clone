    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const copy1 = players.splice();
    const copy2 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const copy3 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const copy2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99}); //{name: 'Wes Bos', age: 80, number: 99}
    const copy3 = Object.assign({}, person, {numebr: 99, age: 12}); // {name: 'Wes Bos', age: 12, number : 99});
    const copy5 = Object.assign({},person) // shallow copy
    
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const copy4 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));


    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const copy6 = {...person}; // shallow copy

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
